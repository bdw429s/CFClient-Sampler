# CFClient-Sampler

My CFClient Sampler app trying out all the client APIs.  

## What is it?

This app is my entry into the [ColdFusion mobile contest](http://blogs.coldfusion.com/post.cfm/mobile-application-development-contest-deadline-extended-to-january-15th).  
I am having a go at all of the CFClient APIs and implementing them all in one application with well-documented code.  The app uses jQuery Mobile for the UI and I am building it using ColdFusion Builder 3 and ColdFusion 11.

## Follow Along

I am also blogging all my findings, successes, and failures on my blog as I go.  Each blog entry has an associated tag in GitHub and a [release of the app](https://github.com/bdw429s/CFClient-Sampler/releases) that has the version of the code discussed in that entry.  I am compiling APK files an testing on my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Each release in GitHub has an attached APK, or just grab the latest from the /dist folder if you want to give the app a try.  *It comes with no warranties and you install it at your own risk!*
